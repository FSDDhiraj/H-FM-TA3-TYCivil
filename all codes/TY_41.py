# Given data
length_km = 100  # in kilometers
width_m = 60  # in meters
pan_evaporation_cm = 0.50  # in centimeters
pan_coefficient = 0.70

# Step 1: Convert length to meters
length_m = length_km * 1000  # 1 km = 1000 m

# Step 2: Surface area of the stream (in square meters)
surface_area_m2 = length_m * width_m

# Step 3: Actual evaporation (adjusted using pan coefficient)
actual_evaporation_cm = pan_evaporation_cm * pan_coefficient

# Step 4: Convert evaporation from cm to meters
actual_evaporation_m = actual_evaporation_cm / 100  # 1 m = 100 cm

# Step 5: Calculate mean daily evaporation loss (volume in cubic meters per day)
evaporation_loss_m3_per_day = surface_area_m2 * actual_evaporation_m

print("Mean daily evaporation loss =", evaporation_loss_m3_per_day, "mÂ³/day")
